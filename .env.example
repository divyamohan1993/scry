# Scry - Configuration File
# ==============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed.
# All values shown are defaults. Only GEMINI_API_KEY is required.
#
# DYNAMIC SETTINGS: Most settings can be changed on-the-fly using the GUI
# Control Panel. Click "Apply Now" to apply changes without restarting.
#
# FIXED CONTROLS: The following keys control the writing panel and CANNOT
# be changed (they remain fixed for reliability):
#   - Backspace: Pause/Resume typing
#   - 9: Emergency Stop (cancels typing)
#   - Right Arrow: Speed Up typing by 10%

# API CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)
# ==============================================================================
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/
#
# SECURITY: Your API key will be automatically encrypted using machine-bound
# encryption. This means:
# - The key is NEVER stored in plain text after first run
# - Copying the project folder to another location INVALIDATES the key
# - Moving the project to another machine INVALIDATES the key
# - You will need to re-enter the key if the project is copied/moved
#
# Enter your plain-text key below. It will be encrypted automatically.

# TRIPLE-PRESS ACTIVATION: All hotkeys must be pressed 3 times consecutively

# Hotkey to trigger MCQ detection (press 3 times, e.g., qqq)

# LICENSING (Owner Control)
# ==============================================================================
# Enable session-based licensing. When enabled, each run requires a one-time
# license key that only the owner can generate.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Software shows a Challenge Code on startup
# 2. Owner signs the challenge with their private key
# 3. User enters the resulting License Key
# 4. License is valid for THIS SESSION ONLY
# 5. On restart, a new license key is required
#
# This prevents unauthorized distribution - even with full source code access,
# users cannot generate valid license keys without the owner's private key.
